            <p>Full of gooey melted chocolate, these chocolate chip cookies are a favorite at any party!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Butter:</strong>Be sure to get the butter out a few hours before beginning to bake for a perfect blend.</li>
                <li><strong>Eggs:</strong>Eggs add the moisture and hold the dough together! Another ingredient you will want to get out a few hours before baking.</li>
                <li><strong>Vanilla:</strong>Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor. Extra points if it's homemade.</li>
                <li><strong>Baking soda:</strong>Baking soda acts as a leavener and helps the cookies rise.</li>
                <li><strong>Water:</strong>A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes which makes the cookies puffy.</li>
                <li><strong>Salt:</strong>A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients. Don't worry, your cookies won't taste salty!</li>
                <li><strong>Flour:</strong>All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to the cookie dough.</li>
                <li><strong>Chocolate chips:</strong>Of course, don't forget the most important ingredient! Use whichever flavor you prefer.</li>
            </ul>
