        <h3>Baked Spaghetti Recipe from AllRecipe</h3>
            <p>Spaghetti is a classic childhood throwback for my family. To switch things up, I sometimes take a family tradition and twist it a bit making baked spaghetti.</p>
            <p>Baked spaghetti can be a good meal for when things are rushed but you still want to put a warm dinner on the table for two or more.</p>
