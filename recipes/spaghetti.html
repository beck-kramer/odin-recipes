        <h3>Baked Spaghetti Recipe from AllRecipe</h3>
            <p>Spaghetti is a classic childhood throwback for my family. To switch things up, I sometimes take a family tradition and twist it a bit making baked spaghetti.</p>
            <p>Baked spaghetti can be a good meal for when things are rushed but you still want to put a warm dinner on the table for two or more.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Noodles:</strong>Spaghetti noodles work best for...spaghetti.</li>
                <li><strong>Beef and onion:</strong>The meat sauce begins with a mixture of ground beef and diced onion.</li>
                <li><strong>Sauce:</strong>A jar of meatless spaghetti sauce can act as a base to your sauce,though you can substitute this for homemade or other sauces if desired.</li>
                <li><strong>Salt:</strong>Seasoned salt enhances the overall flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>Eggs:</strong>Eggs moisturize and help hold the baked spaghetti together.</li>
                <li><strong>Cheeses:</strong>You'll need Parmesan, mozzerella, and cottage cheese to start. Whatever we recommend, you could probably double.</li>
                <li><strong>Butter:</strong>Melted butter gives the dish extra richness and delight.</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>

                <li>Boil and drain the spaghetti.</li>
